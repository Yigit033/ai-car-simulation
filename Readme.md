## Self-Driving Car Simulation Project

### Overview

This project simulates a self-driving car using Python, Pygame, and NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). The goal is to create an AI that can learn how to navigate a car through a defined track without crashing. The AI uses a neural network that evolves over generations to improve its performance.

### Project Structure

- **car.py**: The main file that contains the car class and the simulation logic.
- **config.txt**: Configuration file for NEAT, defining the parameters for the neural network evolution.
- **map.png**: The track image that the car navigates through.
- **car.png**: The car image sprite.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python
